# SQL Activity for CPSC113

Prior to class you read about relational databases and how they store structured
data to enable sophisticated querying. The readings are on the
[class website](https://cpsc113.som.yale.edu/lectures/relational-databases).

In this activity, we will practice the creation of database schemas, and querying
of data. We'll use some movie reviews based on [this activity from
Stanford](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/SQL/SelfPaced/courseware/ch-sql/seq-exercise-sql_movie_mod/).

## How to complete this activity

### Step 0

Find a partner or two in class.

### Step 1

Clone this repository to either your computer or [Cloud9](http://c9.io) or similar
platform where you can use a shell and [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/). This is
pre-installed on Cloud9. If you're on a mac, you likely also have it pre-installed.
(You can type `which sqlite3` to see if you do.)

We are using sqlite instead of other RDBMS such as
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) or [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
because it is easy to set up.

To clone this repo, you'll likely use this command

  git clone https://git.yale.edu/cpsc-113-spring-2016/sql-activity

### Step 2

Create a file called `class-members.txt` and populate it with the netids
of the persons in your group. Mine would look like this

  klj39
  foo42
  bar95

Add that file to your repo with `git add class-members.txt` and commit
it with `git commit`.

### Step 3

Look at the `rating.sql` file. Therein lay some SQL statements around which
we've placed code comments. You'll be filling in missing code in there everywhere
you see `TASK _:`. For example, the first task is to complete the schema of the
database.

### Step 4

Complete the tasks. Each time you alter the code, you can run it like

  sqlite3 -echo my-movie-database.db <rating.sql

The `<` carrat feels the `rating.sql` file into the STDIN file descriptor
for the sqlite3 program. It is a common way to get data into a program that
you would normally type into. The `-echo` option to sqlite will cause the
program to output the result of all your commands.

### Step 5

After you complete each task, make a git commit with a descriptive message.

### Step 6

After you complete all the tasks, or we stop the activity, push your repo
up to [git.yale.edu](http://git.yale.edu) in a new public repo. We'll be
able to see it. This will only be graded for participation.
